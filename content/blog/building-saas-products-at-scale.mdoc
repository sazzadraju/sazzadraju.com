excerpt: Lessons learned from scaling a SaaS platform to 400+ businesses.

Scaling a SaaS platform from a handful of customers to 400+ businesses taught me invaluable lessons about architecture, customer success, and sustainable growth.

When we started, we had a simple MVP serving 10 customers. Fast forward 3 years, and we're now supporting 400+ businesses across multiple industries.

Start Simple, Scale Smart - Don't over-engineer from day one. Build for your current needs, but architect for future growth.

Listen to Your Customers - Our best features came from customer feedback through weekly interviews, monthly feature voting, and quarterly roadmap reviews.

Invest in Infrastructure Early - Key investments included Kubernetes, Redis, PostgreSQL with read replicas, and CDN for static assets.

The Result: $2M+ in annual recurring revenue, 500+ active users, and a product that customers love. The key? Focus on solving real problems, not building features.
